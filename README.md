=============================

An iPad App that works as a touch interface for color correction desktop software. Communicates with the host via wifi. It controlls 3 Way Color Balance Filters like for example the Color Balance Filter in Blender:

Instead of recreating the typical three color wheels, the interface uses a different aproach that should make it possible to use the interface without looking at it to find the right widget for the intendet color correction. The application uses the number of fingers on the screen to figure out wheter the user intends to change the shadow, midtones or highlights in his host application.
